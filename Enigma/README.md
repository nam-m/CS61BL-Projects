## Project 0: Enigma Machine

### Introduction 

Enigma machine was an important piece of technology in the history of cryptography. 
It was used to encrypt and decrypt secret messages, most notably by Germany
before and during World War II. 

### Description

This project simulates the mechanical mechanisms of a real Enigma Machine,
which comprises a plugboard, multiple rotors arranged adjacently on a hub,
and a set of corresponding pawls that triggers rotor movement.
